I recently completed an insightful project on Diwali sales analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook, and I'm excited to share the highlights!
Project Overview
Objective
The main goal was to analyze Diwali sales data to uncover key trends, customer behaviors, and sales performance, ultimately driving data-driven decision-making for strategic marketing and inventory management.
Data Preparation
•	Data Collection: Imported Diwali sales dataset from CSV file.
•	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies using Pandas.
•	Feature Engineering: Created new features such as purchase frequency and average transaction value.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Customer Segmentation: Used K-means clustering to segment customers based on purchase patterns.
•	Sales Trends: Visualized sales trends over time, identifying peak periods and high-demand products.
•	Demographic Insights: Analyzed sales distribution across different demographics using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Predictive Modeling
•	Sales Forecasting: Implemented ARIMA model to forecast future sales during Diwali season.
•	Customer Churn Prediction: Built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn, improving retention strategies.
Insights & Outcomes
•	Identified top-performing product categories and customer segments.
•	Recommended personalized marketing campaigns based on customer segmentation.
•	Provided actionable insights for inventory optimization during peak sales periods.
Tools & Libraries
•	Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
•	NumPy: Numerical computations.
•	Matplotlib, Plotly & Seaborn: Data visualization.
This project not only enhanced my data analysis and machine learning skills but also demonstrated the power of data-driven strategies in boosting sales performance.
